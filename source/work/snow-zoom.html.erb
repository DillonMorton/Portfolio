description: Working with Imulus, I was given the chance to design the logo for the recently launched mobile app, SnowZoom. Although they say there are no friends on a powder day, SnowZoom allows you to catch them up on your tree runs by sharing videos and photos. Combining the shape of a snowflake with the lens aperture blades of a camera seemed very fitting.
