These are conducted with click tests and one-on-one meetings where we watch users interact and click through the workflow. Once we have enough evidence to feel confident in the direction of the UX, we are able to check with the development team to make sure the functionality is plausible to implement within our timeline and&nbsp;budget. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=case-study-step> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class=col-md-8> <img src="/images/work/captainu/05-8cb211fc.jpg"> </div> <div class=col-md-4> <div class=step-info> <h3>Sketches</h3> <p> Every project begins with a design studio, which aims to define the direction, strategy, and a hypothesis to solve a tension for our users. In this project’s case, the opportunity was around improving the steps for athletes to organize, find, and add prospective colleges to their list, since our data shows that athletes who are active with these tools are more likely to upgrade. Once the opportunity is defined, each team member shares a number of quick sketches to drive discussion and to solidify what the solution could become during the wireframe&nbsp;phase. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <div class=work-piece-footer> <div class=container> <a class="work-nav next" href="/work/travely" title=Next>Next<img src="/images/icons/next-487fbec7.png"></a> <a class=work-nav-back href="/#work" title="Back to work"> Back to work </a> </div> </div> <footer id=footer> <div class=container> <div class=row> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/javascripts/application-7ca070c4.js"></script> </body> </html>
